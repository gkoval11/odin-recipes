# Odin Recipes

A repository highlighting the first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This project is a basic website that hosts several recipes, including an image of the finished recipe, a short description, the ingredients required, and the steps necessary to make the recipe. 

## Recipes included: 

* Strawberry rhubarb pie
* Chocolate chocolate chip cookies
* Red velvet cake

Right now the project is just using barebones html to achieve everything. In the future, I plan to come back to add css and javascript to make it a more complete website.
