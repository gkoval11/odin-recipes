# Odin Recipes

A repository highlighting the first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This project is a basic, static website that hosts several recipes, including an image of the finished recipe, a short description, the ingredients required, and the steps necessary to make the recipe. My inspiration for this website is the infamous Simpsons TV series.

## Recipes included: 

* Homer's Patented Space-Age Out-of-this-World Moon Waffles
* Albuquerque Isotope Dogs
* La Bombe Eclair


## Homepage: 

The website is designed to look like the opening credits from the classic Simpsons episodes:

## Things to do still: 

Right now the project is just using barebones html to achieve everything. In the future, I plan to come back to add css and javascript to make it a more complete website. Things to add as I advance through The Odin Project curriculum: 

* Add text jiggle animation when you hover over a recipe so it looks even more like the opening credits
* Add introduction animation of clouds fading with blue sky and put title there instead of "The Simpsons" 
* Maybe add a title card or two highlighting my name as creator before landing on static page of recipe options
