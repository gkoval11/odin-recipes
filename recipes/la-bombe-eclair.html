        <!-- Steps (ordered list) -->

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="list"><strong>Make the choux pastry:</strong>Preheat the oven to 375° F. In a bowl, combine together bread flour, sugar, and butter powder mixing till combined and set aside.</li>
            <li class="list">Combine unsalted butter cut into cubes, water, and milk into a large sauce pot and put over medium heat. Bring to a bare simmer, just once you start to see bubbles around the edge. Do not let it boil.</li>
            <li class="list">In a separate bowl, combine together bread flour, sugar, and butter powder mixing till combined.</li>
            <li class="list">Remove from the heat and add in the dry ingredients. Once all the flour is hydrated and there are no more streaks of dry ingredients, move back onto medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, for five to seven minutes. It will be done once it starts to leave a fond on the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li class="list">Transfer the dough into the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.</li>
            <li class="list">Whisk the eggs until thoroughly beaten, and then slowly pour into the dough while it's mixing on low. Add the eggs little by little until fill incorporated. The final batter will be gooey and make an hourglass between your fingers if you dip them in the dough and then pull apart.</li>
            <li class="list">Line a sheet pan with nonstick spray and parchment paper. Transfer the dough into a piping bag with a decently thick tip and pipe out six pastry fingers onto the sheet pan. You can flatten the tails from piping using your finger dipped in some water.</li>
            <li class="list">Bake for 30-35 minutes, turning on convection for the last 10 minutes of baking, till puffed and golden. The eclairs should be hollow inside to be filled with pastry cream. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
            <li class="list"><strong>Make the pastry filling:</strong>Measure out the beaten eggs into a heatproof bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, 25 grams of sugar, and 50 grams of whole milk. Set aside both bowls.</li>
            <li class="list">Cut the vanilla pod lengthwise and remove the beans from inside. Combine the vanilla in a large saucepan with 400 grams of milk and 50 grams of sugar. Whisk to combine and over medium heat, whisk constantly until steamy and just simmering and remove from the heat. Again, do not let it boil.</li>
            <li class="list">Whisk in 50 grams of sugar with eggs, then slowly stream a small amount hot milk mixture into the eggs while whisking constantly, this will temper the eggs to prevent curdling. Mix the egg mixture into the pan with the rest of the milk and whisk until fully combined.</li>
            <li class="list">Return to medium head and whisk again until a bare simmer. Once it is bubbling, add the cornstarch slurry. Continue whisking for about 1 minute, until the custard is nice and thick. Add in the butter and whisk until melted and incorporated. Remove the vanilla pod.</li>
            <li class="list">Chill the pastry cream by spreading it out on a plastic wrapped lined rim baking sheet. Completely cover the cream with more plastic wrap, pressing directly onto the cream to avoid it forming a skin. Refrigerate for at least an hour, or till it's cool.</li>
            <li class="list"><strong>Make the chocolate glaze:</strong>Place the finely chopped chocolate in a bowl situated over a pot of simmering water. Mix until it has started to melt, then add the cubed unsalted butter, cocoa powder, and corn syrup. Mix until completely smooth and then remove from the heat. Be careful not to let any moisture from the steam of the double boiler get into the chocolate.</li>
            <li class="list"><strong>Make the chantilly cream:</strong>Beat the heavy cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar together until it forms whipped cream.</li>
            <li class="list"><strong>Assemble the eclairs:</strong>Take your cooled eclair shells and into the bottom use a knife to cut three "X"s along the length of the eclair. Move the pastry cream to a piping bag, and then use the "X"s to fill the eclairs until they're maxed out. Hold upside down and dip into the chocolate glaze before holding vertically allowing any excess glaze to run off. Let stand until the chocolate glaze is set (about 15 minutes). Once set, transfer the chantilly cream into a pipping bag, and decoratively pipe a row of cream along the top of each eclair.</li>
            <li class="list">Enjoy!</li>
