    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>A delicious combination of sweet and tart, strawberry rhubarb pie is a must bake in the spring and summer. You can make this recipe with frozen rhubarb, but fresh will always be better. Rhubarb season starts in the early spring (late March to early April) and typically lates through the early summer (May or June). Feel free to make your own pie crust or use a store bought one to save some time. This recipe is borrowed from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12612/rhubarb-and-strawberry-pie/">allrecipes</a>.</p>
