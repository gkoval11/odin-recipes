    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>A classic cake, the red velvet cake traditionally got it's deep red color from the reaction of raw, non-Dutched cocoa powder reacting with the acidic ingredients such as buttermilk and vinegar. This recipe features a more modern approach which just uses food coloring to get that beautiful red color. A common pairing with red velvet cake is cream cheese frosting, but this recipe uses buttercream frosting instead. This recipe is borrowed from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9295/red-velvet-cake/">allrecipes</a>.</p>

    <!-- Steps (ordered list) -->

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cake:</strong> Beat 1 1/2 cups of sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and cocoa powder to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla together in a small bowl. Add the flour, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Mix the vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the icing:</strong> Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
